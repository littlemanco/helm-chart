  Hey! Let's get this bug squashed.

  Try to fill in as much detail as you can. Don't worry about the content between the arrows; that's a comment and
  won't be shown in the actual issue.

  If you're new to writing bugs have a read of:

    https://medium.com/sitewards/writing-a-bug-report-9edbd265bed1<Paste>

  That explains what we need to know and why.

## When did the issue occur?
<!--

  This helps us correlate the issue with diagnostic data that we collect

-->

On __DATE__ at __TIME__

## What are the steps to make the bug occur?
<!--

  If you can make the bug appear reliably that's great! Write the steps down here that allowed you to do this. If
  the bug happened once, just write down as much as you remember. The more detail and the more specific that detail
  is, the better.

### Expected Result

I expected to see `__NORMAL_BEHAVIOUR__`

### Actual result

I observed `__BUGGY_BEHAVIOUR__`

### Screenshots
<!--

  If you have any screenshots, describe them here. Screenshots are surprisingly useful!

-->

### Browser Version
<!--

  If we can pin the bug down to a specific browser we can correlate it with other diagnostic data, as well as reduce
  the amount we need to test to investigate the bug further.

  It's best to simply copy or screenshot all text from the "about us" section of the browser.

### HAR file
<!--

  If you're truly ambitious the best we can possibly hope for is a "HAR file with content". You can save one and
  attach it to this ticket.

  See the following link for details:
